## Introduction
EpicRPG is a must have plugin for RPG servers or servers with quests.
The plugin features a fully functional GUI interface that allows you to
create, customize and edit quests.
Create simple or complex quests such as, picking up an item, going into a specfic region,
right-clicking a block or NPC, and mining blocks.
The plugin also hooks into [Citizens](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/citizens.13811/)
to allow you to create and bind dialogue to NPCs all in one GUI,
so your quests can flow and have mini scenes with backstories told by NPCs if you so desire.

EpicRPG also features the option to customize and hide the objective bossbar,
so players aren't constantly being reminded of a quest,
but instead see a purple particle above the NPC's head who is the starting point of different quests.
